## Problem Set 2

Problem Set 2 dives deep into the **core concepts of probability**. While Problem Set 1 focused primarily on counting principles and combinatorics, with a few problems hinting at their connection to probability, this set takes things further.

Interestingly, you wonâ€™t need any background in counting or combinatorics here. Every problem operates purely at the **probability** level. So if you're eager to practice **probability axioms**, **rules**, and **theorems**, you can skip Problem Set 1 and get started here.
