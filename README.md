## Overview 📠

This repository presents solutions for the Problem Sets of Stanford's **CS109: Probability for Computer Scientists** course. It also serves as an attempt to create additional helpful material for mastering this course, both for myself and, hopefully, for others.  
Currently, the repository has fully completed **pset_1**, while the other problem sets are under development. 🚧

## Materials 📚

The repository uses the following materials to master the course (you may need these if you want to go through the course on your own):

- **[Course Reader](https://chrispiech.github.io/probabilityForComputerScientists/en/)** (up-to-date) 📖
- **[Course Video Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOpr_A7B9SriE_iZmkanvUg)** (Fall 2022) 🎥
- **[Archive of Problem Sets](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1222/)** (Fall 2021) 📂

## Repo Structure 🏠

The mastery of the course is divided by problem sets rather than topics. This means that the course materials are grouped to aid in solving one or another Problem Set. Each problem set has its own folder, and the structure of the folder is as follows:


```
/pset_{i}
│   
├── appendix_{i}.pdf # with Useful Examples from Lectures and Own Task Examples blocks
|
├── pset_{i}_tasks.pdf
|
├── pset_{i}_solutions.pdf # with the link to LaTeX project
│
└── README.md # for navigation purposes
```
